# TimeSeries - A Yen for the Future

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

I will gain proficiency in the following tasks:

1. Time Series Forecasting
2. Linear Regression Modeling
